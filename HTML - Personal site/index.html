                <p>I am a Support Engineer currently but have a life of experience on tenchical, engineering support as well as customer service roles. I have also administrative experience as worked as a Resource Coordinator for <a href="https://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>, understanding by resources the support engineers that would actually support the company's clients. I started working at very basic support levels and progressively made it to higher levels to my current point as an engineer. All of my knowledge I have gathered it through self-learning and researching in the internet. I attempted to get a bachelor at a university but due different factors was unable to achieve such task, nonetheless, that never keeped me from learning and growing personally and professionally.</p></td>
